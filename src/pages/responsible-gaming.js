            Sometimes, players may find it hard to recognize that their online
            play is getting out of control. A common reaction is to minimize,
            hide or deny such problems and the harm it could be causing. Some
            people will lie to themselves about how much money or time is being
            spent on online playing. Following are some of the best practices to
            help you play responsibly:
          </p>

            money or escape problems. Never chase your losses while playing. Set
            aside an entertainment budget. Keep track of the time and monitor
            the amount of money you spend. Use the Add Cash limit option to help
            control the amount you spend. Balance the time you spend on playing
